When test frameworks are test test environment aware, they are truly portable and usuable by everyone, following framework features need to be provided :

1). Create and Destroy test setups : 
Given n number of host IPs, the framework should be able to dynamically create test environment, specific to test cases.
The framework should read from setup config and do the necessary work. 
This will provide maximum flexibility and portability for unit, ui and integration testing.

2). Assume test setups :
Use existing setups to executing all applicable test cases. 
The test infrastructure should not be a limitation. Framework should execute a minimum set of TCs, with given infra resources and 
not just fail.

3). Docker based test setups :
There is an opportunity to build a docker container based unit, integration testing setup support.
CP scalibility testing is already docker based and using locust in master slave config with kubernetes.

NOTE : Current focus
Till the 2.7 APA release, #2 is the focus of implementation.
